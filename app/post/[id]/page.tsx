  text: "Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This post is the second instalment of my series 'Roast the Code', where I share some code, and let YOU roast and/or improve it. There's not much more to it, just be polite and constructive. This time it's a minesweeper game called Bugsweeper, written in Dart and UI built using Flutter. Just a little fun project I wrote last Saturday. You can check it out here (note that the site can take a bit to load, I will be writing a post related to this in the near future)",
